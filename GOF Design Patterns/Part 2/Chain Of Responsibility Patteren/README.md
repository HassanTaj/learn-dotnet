# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chains the receiving objects and passes the request along the chain until an object handles it.

## Simple Explanation:
Passing on the responsibility of a task from one object to another, and so forth, until an object accepts the responsibility and completes it. This pattern decouples the sender and receiver, allowing for flexible and dynamic handling of requests.
