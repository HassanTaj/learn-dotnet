# Template Method Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Simple Explanation:
The Template Method Pattern allows child classes to change some steps of an algorithm without altering the algorithm's overall structure. This pattern is useful for defining the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allowing subclasses to fill in the details.
