# Strategy Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Simple Explanation:
The Strategy Pattern allows a client to choose an algorithm from a group of algorithms and provides a simple way to access it. This pattern enables the selection of an algorithm's behavior at runtime, making the system more flexible and easier to extend.
