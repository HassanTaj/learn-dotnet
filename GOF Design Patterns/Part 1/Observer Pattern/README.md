# Observer Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Simple Explanation:
A change in one object causes a change or action in another object by notifying it. This pattern is useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems, where multiple objects need to be informed about changes in the state of a particular object.
