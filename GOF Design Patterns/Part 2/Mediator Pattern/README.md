# Mediator Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and lets you vary their interaction independently.

## Simple Explanation:
The Mediator Pattern lets you control the communication between each object. It centralizes the interaction logic, making it easier to manage and modify the way objects communicate with each other.
