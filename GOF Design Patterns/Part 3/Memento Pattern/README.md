# Memento Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Without violating encapsulation, captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

## Simple Explanation:
The Memento Pattern is used to track the states of an object so that you can go back and forth between different states. This pattern is useful for implementing undo mechanisms and saving the state of an object without exposing its internal details.
