# Decorator Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Simple Explanation:
The Decorator Pattern is all about using composition to limit inheritance and simplify object relationships, making them more manageable.

## Also Known As:
Sometimes, the Decorator Pattern is also referred to as the Wrapper Pattern because the processes it uses involve wrapping.
