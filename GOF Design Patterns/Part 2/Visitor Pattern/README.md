# Visitor Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## Simple Explanation:
The Visitor Pattern lets you add and perform new functionality on objects without changing their structure, which might otherwise cause problems. This pattern is useful for separating algorithms from the objects on which they operate, making the system more flexible and easier to extend.
