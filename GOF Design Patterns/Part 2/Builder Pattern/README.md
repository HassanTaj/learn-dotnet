# Builder Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Simple Explanation:
The Builder Pattern allows you to separate and reuse a specific process to build something. This pattern is particularly useful when the construction process is complex and you want to ensure that the construction logic is decoupled from the representation of the object being built.
