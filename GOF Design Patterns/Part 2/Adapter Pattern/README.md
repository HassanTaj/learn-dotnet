# Adapter Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Simple Explanation:
The Adapter Pattern makes incompatible interfaces compatible by enabling them to work together. This pattern is useful for integrating existing classes with incompatible interfaces into a new system.
