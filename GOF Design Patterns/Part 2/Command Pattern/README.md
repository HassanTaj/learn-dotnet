# Command Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

## Simple Explanation:
The Command Pattern uses an object to store the required information to perform an action at any point in time. This allows for decoupling the sender and receiver of a request, making the system more flexible and easier to manage.
