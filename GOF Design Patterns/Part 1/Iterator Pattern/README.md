# Iterator Pattern

## Gang of Four:
Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## Simple Explanation:
It's a way to access and iterate through collections in the same way, regardless of type. This means you can traverse different types of collections (such as lists, arrays, or custom data structures) using the same interface.

Sometimes, a collection can also be referred to as a container or an aggregate.
