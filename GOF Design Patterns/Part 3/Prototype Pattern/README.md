# Prototype Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

## Simple Explanation:
The goal of the Prototype Pattern is to create an object based on another object. This pattern is useful for creating new objects by cloning existing ones, which can be more efficient than creating them from scratch, especially when the object creation process is complex.
