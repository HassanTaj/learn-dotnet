# Bridge Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Simple Explanation:
The Bridge Pattern is used to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that both can be modified independently. This pattern promotes flexibility and reusability by allowing the abstraction and implementation to evolve separately.
