# Composite Pattern

## Gang of Four Definition:
The Composite Pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Simple Explanation:
The Composite Pattern is all about treating a group of objects and a single object in the same way, even though they can be different. This allows for a consistent interface for both individual objects and compositions of objects.
